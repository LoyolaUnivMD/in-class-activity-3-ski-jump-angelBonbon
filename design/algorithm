1. Ask the user for the type of jump (either normal or large) and set the variable to jumpType
2. Ask the user what their speed was at the end of the ramp and set to endSpeed
3. Initialize dist and points to 0
4. if jumpType is equal to "normal"
    a. Set dist equal to endSpeed times sqrt(2*46/9.8)
    b. Set points to 60 + (dist-90)*2
5. if jumpType is equal to "large"
    a. Set dist equal to endSpeed times sqrt(2*70/9.8)
    b. Set points to 60 + (dist-120)*1.8
6. Output distance (dist) and points to the user
7. if points is greater than or equal to 61
    a. Output "Great job for doing better than par!" to the user
8. Otherwise if points are less than 10
    a. Output "What happened" to the user
9. Otherwise
    a. Output "Sorry you didn't get very far" to the user
